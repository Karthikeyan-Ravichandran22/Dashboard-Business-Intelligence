# Revenue and Units Analysis with SQL,BI,Tableau

The project centered around consolidating disparate tables using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to create a unified table, streamlining data visualization and analysis. Initially, the relevant tables containing essential data were identified, potentially originating from various sources or representing distinct data facets. Leveraging SSMS, these tables were joined based on common keys or relationships, resulting in a consolidated table that contained comprehensive information.

The consolidated table served as a centralized data repository, eliminating the need to navigate multiple tables and simplifying the process of visualizing and analyzing insights. This consolidation alleviated the requirement for repeated complex queries or joins during subsequent analyses.

To enhance accessibility and visual appeal, a Power BI dashboard was developed, capitalizing on the robust capabilities of this business intelligence tool. The dashboard presented the consolidated data in an engaging and visually pleasing manner, enabling users to quickly grasp insights.

Comprising diverse visual elements such as charts, graphs, and tables, the dashboard depicted key metrics, trends, and patterns in the data. Users could interact with the dashboard, applying filters to focus on specific criteria or delving into granular details. This interactivity facilitated exploration and the extraction of meaningful insights from the consolidated data.

Overall, the project effectively utilized SSMS to consolidate tables, simplifying data visualization and analysis. The resultant Power BI dashboard offered a user-friendly and interactive interface, empowering users to derive actionable insights from the consolidated data and make informed decisions based on data-driven strategies.
