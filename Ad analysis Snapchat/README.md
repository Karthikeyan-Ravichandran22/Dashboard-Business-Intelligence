# Snapchat Advertisements Data Analysis
Executed a comprehensive data analysis procedure to unveil the methods employed by Snapchat, a popular social media application, in targeting its audience through advertisements.

Conducted data cleaning using MS Excel and implemented SQL to enhance the data analysis process.

Constructed a visually engaging Tableau dashboard to analyze the data, generating insightful quantitative visualizations. The focus was on understanding how Snapchat strategically targets its audience by considering various factors and examining the significant influence of major events on social media usage patterns.
The goal of this project is to practice creating and interpreting different types of visualizations using real world data. I have created three multiple bar Graphs 
which shows different relations between different factors. I have created five Donut graph which has its own Graphs when you Hover over it. One line Graph and One slop Graph for showing visualization.
                
## ABOUT SNAPCHAT: 
Snapchat is a multimedia messaging app that allows users to send and receive photos, videos, and messages that disappear after being viewed. It was developed by a team of students from Stanford University. The key individuals behind the development of Snapchat are Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown. Evan Spiegel is often credited as the co-founder and CEO of Snapchat. The app was first released in 2011, and it quickly gained popularity, particularly among younger audiences, due to its unique feature of temporary or ephemeral messaging.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED:

Advance Excel
MySQL & SQL Server
Tableau
Statistics
     
## TASKS ACHEIVED:
Generate a vertical bar graph illustrating the cumulative count of advertisements for each country.

Display informative boxes summarizing the total number of countries, total impressions, and total expenditure on advertisements.

Create a donut graph presenting the distribution of ads targeting different factors such as age, segments, language, interests, gender, and other relevant variables.

Implement interactive functionality within each donut graph to display an individual graph upon hovering over it.

Construct a line graph showcasing the timeline of targeted advertising.

Develop a bar graph comparing the total impressions with the corresponding amount of money spent by companies on ads.

Construct a slope graph depicting the expenditure on advertisements for each country from 2018 to 2019.

## DASHBOARD CONTAINS:

The dashboard incorporates a comprehensive analysis through the utilization of three bar graphs, each offering unique insights and contributing to the overall understanding.

Within the dashboard, five donut graphs play a significant role in the analysis. Each donut graph encompasses its own graph, which holds critical importance in providing valuable information and enhancing the analytical process.

The dashboard showcases the implementation of one line graph and one slope graph, both of which serve as valuable tools in visualizing and interpreting the data.

An interactive feature within the dashboard allows users to explore the characteristics of each donut graph by hovering over them, revealing individual graphs that further explain their specific attributes. This approach effectively presents a wealth of information in a concise and engaging manner.

The dashboard shows:

   1) The User can see which country has most number of ads and which country has least.
   2) The Dashboard will provide interactive interface of list of factors on which Snapchat Ads most and least depend upon.
   3) The Dashboard will show how different events shape the Ads targeting based on user.
   4) The Dashboard can compair two counties based on how much money spent on them by different top 5 companies.
   5) The Dashboard will show the money spent on different countries from 2018 to 2019.
 
## FINDINGS:
Prior to Major Political Elections, there is a notable surge in the number of active ads for the top 5 countries where Snapchat ads enjoy significant popularity.

Among the 29 countries analyzed, Denmark and Iraq stand out as the only countries witnessing a decline in expenditure on Snapchat ads. Conversely, all other countries have displayed an upward trend in ad spending.

It is crucial for the younger generation to exercise caution regarding the impact of political ads on their decision-making processes. Remarkably, 75% of these ads specifically target individuals aged 18, and there are instances of ads being directed at individuals as young as 14 years old.

As election dates approach, it becomes increasingly important for us to be mindful of the potential influence exerted by advertisements. We should strive to avoid being swayed by biased ads, just as we endeavor to remain unaffected by biased news sources.
